# Part 6 — Accessing Files from All Devices

---

## 6.1 — MacBook — Nextcloud (browser)

| Where you are | Address to use |
|---|---|
| Home WiFi | `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP/nextcloud` |
| Anywhere globally (Tailscale ON) | `http://YOUR_TAILSCALE_IP/nextcloud` |

Login: `YOUR_NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN` / `YOUR_NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD`

---

## 6.2 — MacBook — Nextcloud Desktop App

- Download: https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients → macOS
- Install → open → Log in → server: `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP/nextcloud`
- Login: `YOUR_NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN` / `YOUR_NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD`
- A Nextcloud folder appears in Finder — drag any files or folders in to sync automatically to 4TB drive

---

## 6.3 — MacBook — Samba (Finder)

**Home WiFi:**
- Finder → `Command+K` → type: `smb://YOUR_LOCAL_IP` → Connect
- Select Registered User → Username: `YOUR_SAMBA_USERNAME` → Password: `YOUR_SAMBA_PASSWORD`
- Select `4TB` → OK → appears in Finder sidebar under Locations

**From anywhere globally:**
- Make sure Tailscale icon in menu bar is active (connected)
- Finder → `Command+K` → type: `smb://YOUR_TAILSCALE_IP` → same login

**Auto-reconnect after restart or sleep (macOS fix):**
- System Settings → General → Login Items → click `+` → select the mounted drive

> **INFO:** macOS has a known Apple bug where SMB shares disconnect after sleep/restart. Adding to Login Items is the Apple-recommended workaround.
